Finally under the Code Generator section there will be a Google form in which they need to type the referral code.<br>
If the Referral code matches with the given referral code sent to the user, then the user will get a valid discount
<br>
Finally we have a feedback section for generating the feedback of the users and hence valuable for any of the companies.<br>
